# RUNE: Your AI Study Companion

## Overview

**RUNE** is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to streamline and enhance the digital learning experience. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, RUNE transforms traditional educational content into interactive and digestible study aids. This tool is tailored for students to overcome challenges like information overload, unorganized materials, and limited learning support.

## Core Features

- **Automated Content Processing**: Extracts and summarizes information from digital resources (e.g., PDFs) into concise formats.
- **Interactive Study Aids**: Creates flashcards, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), diagrams, and summaries for active learning.
- **Real-Time Doubt Resolution**: Provides instant clarifications for student queries through an intuitive interface.
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Organizes study material as per syllabus requirements to ensure relevance.
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Adapts to individual learning preferences, enabling a unique and efficient study approach.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Flask framework for seamless integration of data flow and processing.
- **AI Model**: Llama for NLP functionalities like summarization, content generation, and question-answering.
- **Database**: Vector database for efficient retrieval and storage of high-dimensional embeddings.

## System Architecture

The architecture is modular, scalable, and consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend (React)**: Provides the interface for interaction with features like summaries, flashcards, and doubts.
2. **Backend (Flask)**: Coordinates the data flow between the frontend and the AI model.
3. **Vector Database**: Optimizes information retrieval, ensuring fast and contextually accurate responses.
4. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Powers the core functionalities, including summarization and MCQ generation.
